# What is this project?

This project is a little about functions in C.

What we see is a code that when he's runned(after compiling it through writing make all -> ./connections) you get to input a matrix after pressing 'A', the matrix represents a graph and every row/column is a point.

After inputing x numbers(must be x^2 keys) through the matrix pressing 'B' + 2 digits(of points) you know if there is a route between them.

Pressing 'C'+2 digits will give u the best route between 2 points(Floyd-Warshall's algorithem).

And pressing 'D' will finish the programn.

# How to activate

Please open a Linux enviroment (or use bash on cmd) and type "make all", after that all the files will apear and you will have to open the ./exe file

Hope you enjoy my writings and find good usage to them :)
